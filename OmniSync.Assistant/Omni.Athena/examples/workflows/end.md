# /end — Session Close Script (Lightweight)

> **Latency Profile**: LOW (~2K tokens)  
> **Core Principle**: "Fast close. Deep work deferred to /refactor."  
> **Change Log**: 2025-12-27 — Added Canonical Memory Sync (Protocol 215).
> **Change Log**: 2025-12-27 — Added Canonical Memory Sync (Protocol 215).
> **Change Log**: 2025-12-18 — Moved heavy audits to `/refactor` for faster session close.

## 1. Session Log Finalization

> **Rule**: Quick consolidation, not deep synthesis.

1. **Read** the current session log (created at `/start`).
2. **Append** key bullets:
   * Main topics covered
   * Key decisions made
   * Notable insights (if any)
3. **Add** closure block:

```markdown
## Session Closed

**Status**: ✅ Closed  
**Time**: [HH:MM SGT]
```

## 1.2 Canonical Memory Sync (Protocol 215)

> **Rule**: Check for stale data. Update the Materialized View.

1. **Diff**: Did we establish new costs, decisions, or facts that contradict `.context/CANONICAL.md`?
2. **Sync**: If yes, **update `.context/CANONICAL.md` immediately**.
3. **Log**: "Updated Canonical: [Fact A] -> [Fact B]"

## 1.3 Session Checkpoint (S__)

> **Rule**: Generate a compressed state block for the next session.

1. **Context**: What *must* the next session know immediately?
2. **Generate**:

   ```text
   [[ S__ |
   @focus: [Current Task/Project]
   @status: [Active/Paused]
   
   @decided: [Key Decision A], [Key Decision B]
   @pending: [Next Step X], [Next Step Y]
   
   !checkpoint ]]
   ```

3. **Append**: Add this block to the end of the Session Log.

## 1.5 Shutdown Orchestrator

> **Rule**: Single script handles harvest check, git commit, and compliance.

// turbo

```bash
# Reference: python3 scripts/shutdown.py
```

**What it does**:

1. Harvest check (§0.7 enforcement)
2. Git commit & push (triggers cloud sync)
3. Protocol compliance report
4. Reset violations for next session

**Output**: "✅ Session closed. Time: [HH:MM SGT]"

## What Moved to /refactor

> **Philosophy**: `/end` is for fast exit. `/refactor` is for deep maintenance.

| Previously in /end | Now in /refactor |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| `batch_audit.py` | ✅ Moved |
| `orphan_detector.py` verification gate | ✅ Moved |
| Living Doc metabolic scans | ✅ Moved |
| Cross-pollination scans (Protocol 67) | ✅ Moved |
| GraphRAG re-indexing | Already in /refactor |
| `compress_memory.py` | ✅ Moved |
| `compress_sessions.py` | ✅ Moved |
| `supabase_sync.py` | ✅ Moved |

**When to use /refactor**:

* After multiple light sessions
* Before major new work phases
* Weekly maintenance (recommended)

## Summary

| Phase | Action | Tokens |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 1. Session Log | Quick finalize | ~300 |
| 1.5 Harvest Check | Gate unharvested knowledge | ~100 |
| 2. Git Commit | Commit changes | ~100 |
| 3. Compliance Report | Surface protocol violations | ~100 |
| **Total** | — | **~600** |
