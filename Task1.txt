This tasks consists of a couple minor subtasks. After finishing a task build and deploy then rely on user to approve each subtask before you git commit between each task. 

For the hub
DONE In windows tray, right click omni hub -> exit does not seem to work anymore, it used to work

in OmniSync.Android
DONE The Remote control screen needs special buttons for spacebar, esc, and buttons for multibutton actions alt-tab, alt-f4, ctrl-W, ctrl-A->backspace (clear all). Add another row to fit these in.
DONE The Remote control screen needs a volume slider that adjusts windows volume (may require a hub update as well
DONE The trackpad area needs to send left click with quick tap or right click with long 2 second stationary (with threshold) tap 
 - Trackpad clicking status: We had clicking working but some messy code changes were made, use git status to see where we are
DONE The process screen, when killing a process, needs to verify the process is gone after a short delay and then remove it from the list without resetting scroll amount. 
On the dashboard the automatic reconnect doesnt work, i have to click the manual connect button and then it will reconnect fine.
On the dashboard. If we disconnect it will show an error which is good, but if we then succesfully and manually reconnect, it will not clear the error  keep showing a connection error, e.g. "Error: failed to connecto 10.0.0.37 (port 50000) from 10.0.0.236... connection refused", even as the green checkmark and background turns green, it also keeps attempting to reconnect even though the manual reconnect succeeded. The reconnect button also disappears
