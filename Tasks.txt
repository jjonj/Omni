# Tasks
When finishing a task make sure to prefix the line with "DONE" and also git commit between each one.

## General

## For the hub
DONE Run on startup is not working, windows is trying to run D:\SSDProjects\Omni\OmniSync.Hub\src\OmniSync.Hub\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows\OmniSync.Hub.dll on startup which is nonsensical
Play a sound 1 minute before shutdown will activate, use Resources/shut1min.wav


### Hub window
Long press on shutdown should switch to sleep instead, syncing with android app button state.


## in OmniSync.Android

### General

### Dashboard

### Remote Control Screen
There is a wierd jagged overlapping issue  at the border between the black area of the button panel and the trackpad area, the bottom and top dont align/meet properly causing janky look. Careful not to break the button panel moving/resizing. Maybe ensure that the panel is always infront of the trackpad or make sure their borders align
Stream PC monitor, replacing background of the trackpad leaving the trackpad functioning still, options to toggle monitor, pinch to zoom, (advanced feature, do last)       
Long press on shutdown button does switch it to a sleep icon but the hub still shows shutdown, so i dont know if it will shutdown or sleep

### Files Screen
Bookmarking works! but The manage bookmark panel should be at the bottom of the files screen, not bottom
Downloading a video into app data and optionally password protecting it with encryption and password. Should be deletable

WORKING Swiping finger up and down on left side should change phone brightness
NOT-WORKING Swiping finger up and down on  right side should change phone or video volume.     
NOT-WORKING  Double tap to skip forward/back no longer working. (probably broke when fixing brightness sliding. We used to have this working using overlay boxes on the left and right side that could also be used for volume change (and brightness?)
EVEN MORE Text editing fancy features, think like a lite code editor like notepad++ or VS code. be creative. MORE options in burger menu with lots of options
DONE File system caching - remember all paths all files that have been listed IF They are inside (recursively) any bookmark, allowing to browse file system even after disconnecting
DONE Text file content caching - remember the content of all files opened as text even when disconnected
DONE File Cached editing - ALlow editing text files while disconnected, apply the change when reconnecting IF and only IF the the file date modified before saving matches the cached one  (aka the file hasnt changed since we last cached it). Otherwise save it with postfix .conflicted
DONE Cached file creation - Allow creating text files while disconnected that will be saved to PC when reconnecting


### Browser control screen
Play/Pause media works, but it works on current tab. Could we try getting it to work for whatever is/was the currently/most recently playing media. Or alternatively pause all playing media if any, otherwise play current tabs media would also be ok


### Notification panel
Make the buttons have different/better background

### Home screen widgets
Add support for widgets, when you add a widget you can choose a quick action (same as the list from notifications)

### Settings screen (accessed by button on dashboard, not bottom panel)
Quick actions dropdown: Add options to go directly to each screen in the app, add options to go to open a bookmark from the browser control screen (opens on the pc like the bookmarks do)

### AI screen (new)
I want to be able to use gemini commands, e.g. /dir add D:/SSDProjects, currently it just sends it as a string to gemini and the ai responds instead of affecting the gemini cli harness. Please carefully read through the 

## Web (new)
DONE Hub screen doesnt work/receive updates.
