## General

## For the hub

### Hub window
DONE See similar android task: Button on hub window to set PC to turn off after X time. Clicking botton toggles between None/15min/30min/60min/2hours/5hours/12hours cycling back to none. To turn off PC schedule a call to C:\Windows\explorer.exe "B:\GDrive\Tools\05 Automation\shutdown.bat"
DONE Remove the Test Input button (do this tiny task whenever you are touching the hub code anyway)
DONE Hub window should look better/more modern UI and have a dark theme
Hub window shutdown timer does not update (its stuck at e.g. 14m 59s without counting down)
Startup on windows start does not work

## in OmniSync.Android

### General
DONE Change reconnect attempt period from 3s to 10s
DONE Using android back button should go back to the previous screen we were on instead of closing app, remember up to 3 screens. If no previous screen in history then go to dashboard. If going back twice on dashboard then close app.


### Dashboard
DONE Quick actions, remove buttons test echo, list notes, test clipboard. Instead add buttons for Shutdown ( "B:\GDrive\Tools\05 Automation\shutdown.bat") and Sleep ("B:\GDrive\Tools\05 Automation\sleep.bat") and TV ("B:\GDrive\Tools\05 Automation\TVActive3\tv_toggle.bat")
DONE Add quick action button to send "magic packet" for wake on lan. Use broadcast mask 10.0.0.255 and mac address 10FFE0379DAC use port 9
DONE Remove some of the overly verbose logging to the activity hub


### Remote Control Screen
DONE Special Button panel is ugly and takes up too much space
DONE Shift, Alt and Ctrl toggling is broken, should be intelligent about highlighting button
DONE See similar hub task: Button to set PC to turn off after X time. Clicking botton toggles between None/15min/30min/60min/2hours/5hours/12hours cycling back to none. To turn off PC schedule a call to C:\Windows\explorer.exe "B:\GDrive\Tools\05 Automation\shutdown.bat". Text on button updates with each click.      
DONE Recent commits made it so the button panel no longer floats above the android keyboard when the keyboard pops up, refix this.
Stream screen, replacing background of the trackpad leaving the trackpad functioning still, options to toggle monitor, pinch to zoom, (advanced feature, do last)

### Files Screen
Downloading a video into app data and optionally password protecting it with encryption and password. Should be deletable
DONE Problem when switching phone orientation the video restarts
DONE Video player fullscreen/horizontal mode 
Video player pinch to zoom.
DONE double tapping right and left side of video should skip forward/back 10 seconds
Support to open more file types, unknown filetypes should open as a text file
Support for editing files opened as text files
Bookmarking folders
Video player has a previous and next button built in, hook into those buttons and find the next/previous video in the current folders
Swiping finger up and down on left side should change phone brightness and right side should change phone volume
Text editing fancy features, think like a lite code editor like notepad++ or VS code. be creative.
Search for files (relative to current folder), when file found have a button to open containing folder. Quick/long tapping file should work like normal.

### Browser control screen
Add a button to open current chrome tab url on phone (send to default browser)
The [arrow down] button next to clean tabs does not do anything. its supposed to open a list of the urls to auto close during clean tabs action.
Button to open a list of all tabs open in chrome with in-row buttons to close each one (for manual tab cleanup). The tab rows should not display the URL but the tab title
Bookmark current URL should bookmark the currently open chrome tab, not the entered url
Make bookmarks reorderable
Button to play/pause whatever media is currently playing (dunno how this could be done but give it a try)

### Notification panel
In the android notification area there should be a panel with quick actions. Touching the notification outside the buttons should open the app.

### Settings screen (accessed by button on dashboard, not bottom panel)
Add setting for video player next/previous buttons whether they should play next video by file order or random
Add setting for how far to skip forward/back when double tapping in video player (default 10s)
Settings for what buttons should be in the notification quick actions panel, try to add as many possibilities here that you think could be done with a single button, especially from the Dashboard/Quick actions, remote control and browser control screens. also add option for custom buttons that will send a run/cmd command that will be executed on the pc.

### AI screen (new)
An AI screen that lets us talk to an LLM chatbot in a CLI running on the PC. Will work like gemini CLI but the interface is on the phone and the actions are on the PC. probably involves making a custom version/branch/fork of gemini CLI (which is on github). I have a fork checked out at D:\SSDProjects\Tools\gemini-cli but it needs an upstream remote and to rebase on that remote, maybe diverge away from the one commit i put on top if conflicting too much for now.


## Web (new)
Hub should include a webserver acessible on port 3333, the server should communicate with the hub like other parts of the system.
Webpage should default to a page that is a copy of OmniSync.Web\IntegrateThisIntoWeb
