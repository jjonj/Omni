# Tasks

When finishing a task make sure to prefix the line with "DONE" and also git commit between each one.
if told to do a megasession then fix/implement as many issues of the ones below as possible without user intervention. Make sure to git commit and mark as DONE between each one. Start with any tasks that can be validated with a script in D:\SSDProjects\Omni\TestScripts. If strictly necessary you may use AISpeak to ask the user for help/clarifications.



## General

DONE Show a notification in the app when connecting/disconnecting from hub
The app is somehow fullscreen all the time, hiding the top android bar that shows time and notification icons etc. I only want this in horizontal mode. 

## For the hub
Right click tray icon -> exit is slow, can we be more forceful?

### Hub window


## in OmniSync.Android

### General

DONE Can we make settings/configurations persistent between reinstalls of the app? (implemented via ConfigManager in external storage)
DONE The dashboard has two cog icons with settings in the upper right, merge them into one. 

### Dashboard

### Remote Control Screen
Stream PC monitor, replacing background of the trackpad leaving the trackpad functioning still, options to toggle monitor, pinch to zoom, (advanced feature, do last)       
We are using a text field to trick android into letting us use the keyboard which works really well but has some minor issues:
 - NOT WORKING (In fact got worse) Android erase from right button works but only when the textfield has content. Could we maybe ensure the textfield always has a character to erase (ofc without sending that character to the pc)
DONE Reduce trackpad sensitivity by another 20%

### Files & Video Screen

  
Downloading a video as encrypted currently prompts for the password, is it possible to encrypt without asking for password? isnt that what a public key is for? Only ask for password if no global password is set
Downloaded videos (encrypted or not) do not play. The player just shows 0.00/0.00 and black screen
Right click menu for a downloaded file should not show "open on pc" or "download video to app" as it doesnt make sense. The "Download & Open (Ext app)" option should not have the "Download" and doesnt work as it tries to download. 
Deleting local files work but the file list doesnt update. 
The password is not currently changable, should be set in dashboard->settings

Normal tap on save button should not save->exit, just save 


DONE Add a panel similar to bookmarks to manage cached files, where they can be uncached
 - Menu added but when clearing all or individual cahced files/folders the list does not update. 
 - The menu only lists cached folders, should include files
DONE Investigate if there is a way to have the hub be notified whenever a cached file is changed on PC so that the android app can update its cached version, this is a nice to have, we definitely dont want to do periodic polling
DONE - Use this feature to notify user with a popup if the file was changed remotely while the file is open as text
       -- Feature works but add buttons to discard local changes and reload
       -- Ensure auto save feature doesnt overwrite remote changes, add star icon to indicate autosave isnt saving in this state
	   
	   
Remove the button left of + that opens list of downloaded files. we now have the root virtual folders for that. 

Video:
Still Cant use the back button in upper right, probably because the overlay areas are blocking it, make the overlay areas less wide on the outer area
 - I think you changed the overlay area to be less wide but it is still covering the edges of the screen. There should be non overlayed space on the edges as well as in the middle
The embedded video player we are using is still being a bit annoying with showing/hiding the player buttons. This didnt used to happen, it just kinda got slightly unstable in its activation. - fixing this requires user to check for regressions
 - When i tap the screen and the player buttons are not visible then they will turn visible for a second and then unexpected disappear again, as if i tapped twice. Same happens when they are visible and i tap to hide them, then they hide for 1sec then reappear. I have to tap 3 times to actually toggle their visibility

More Text editing fancy features, think like a lite code editor like notepad++ or VS code. be creative. MORE options in burger menu with lots of options
Search/replace menu with higlighting findings and next/prev found
Toggle word wrap
Save as copy
Have multiple files open at once (Swiping side by side between them, have a button opening dropdown with them, option to close all with a dialog for each unsaved file whether to save
Bold/italic/strikethrough options on right clicking selected text
Link insertion in burger menu
Advanced bar below the header with the following options (use icons not text)
	Duplicate line
	Delete line
	Move line up/down
	Copy line
	Paste

Highlight matching brackets/parentheses
Pinch to zoom (font size change), allow zooming out very far
Version history / undo across sessions


### Browser control screen

Change button text from  "↺📱" and "↺🌐" to "▶↺📱" and "▶↺🌐"
Make the ▶↺🌐 button respect the New tab toggle
Move the button to the right of the URL bar to open current remote tab on phone to the advanced buttons panel and change icon to "🌐→📱"
Add clear icon to the right of URL bar. 


DONE chrome extension does not seem to work on startup need to disable/reenable for it to connect properly it seems

### Notification panel
Make the buttons have 2 pixels margin between them and use a dark blue background istead of the current blue
When changing quick actions the notification does not instantly update
Hide the "Omni - COnnected" title, just show buttons.


### Android Home screen widgets
NOT-WORKING Add support for android launcher widgets, when you add a widget you can choose a quick action (same as the list from notifications)

### Settings screen (accessed by button on dashboard, not bottom panel)



### Alarm screen
NOT WORKING When alarm pops, force open the omnihub app to open. Do we not have permission from android to open an app automatically? im pressure sure other alarm apps do. 
Dismissing alarm from notification does not seem to work, at least while its snoozing
Dismissing alarm from alarm screen does not deactivate a non repeating alarm like expected.

### Smart home integration
DONE Read SmartFeature.txt (implemented ExternalCommandController in Hub)

## Web
