# Tasks
When finishing a task make sure to prefix the line with "DONE" and also git commit between each one.

## General

## For the hub	
DONE Run on startup is not working, windows is trying to run D:\SSDProjects\Omni\OmniSync.Hub\src\OmniSync.Hub\bin\Debug\net9.0-windows\OmniSync.Hub.dll on startup which is nonsensical


### Hub window
DONE NOT WORKING - Long press on the button just acts as a normal press - See also ### Remote Control Screen. The shutdown timer button should have a long press action that toggles it between shutdown and sleep. should ofc sync between app and hub

## in OmniSync.Android

### General
DONE Swiping on the navigation bar should switch screens left/right

### Dashboard

### Remote Control Screen
DONE The buttons look good but are STILL a bit too tall taking up too much vertical space
DONE FAILED FIX There is STILL a weird jagged overlapping issue between the black area of the button panel and the trackpad area, the bottom and top dont align/meet properly causing janky look. Careful not to break the button panel moving/resizing.
Stream PC monitor, replacing background of the trackpad leaving the trackpad functioning still, options to toggle monitor, pinch to zoom, (advanced feature, do last)       
DONE NOT WORKING - Long press on the button just acts as a normal press - See also ### Hub window. The shutdown timer button should have a long press action that toggles it between shutdown and sleep

### Files Screen
DONE The top right of the files screen has a Star bookmark button, that button should bookmark the current folder, not open a bookmarks manager. The manage bookmarks window should be opened by a burger menu in the bookmarks panel at the bottom. The bookmarks manager should be at the bottom with the bookmarks, not at the top.
Downloading a video into app data and optionally password protecting it with encryption and password. Should be deletable

DONE  Swiping finger up and down on left side should change phone brightness
DONE STILL-NOT-WORKING Swiping finger up and down on  right side should change phone volume.     
DONE STILL-NOT-WORKING  Double tap to skip forward/back no longer working. (probably broke when fixing brightness sliding
EVEN MORE Text editing fancy features, think like a lite code editor like notepad++ or VS code. be creative. Make a burger menu with lots of options

### Browser control screen
DONE STILL-NOT-WORKING - - extension gives error: Uncaught (in promise) Error: Cannot access contents of url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojTSVmRmLFs". Extension manifest must request permission to access this host." - Button to play/pause whatever media is currently playing. Maybe we just need to try like 5 different ways at once and if that works we can narrow done which one is actually doing it. This requires lots of research.


### Notification panel
DONE The quick actions work but preferably the buttons dont require expanding the notification and exist straight on the notification.
DONE Adding/removing actions does not update the notification.
### Settings screen (accessed by button on dashboard, not bottom panel)

### AI screen (new)
DONE AI Chat doesnt seem to work from android.  I get Error: Gemini CLI timed out after 60 seconds. are we sure D:\SSDProjects\Omni\TestScripts\test_ai_integration.py works? Why does it work but android doesnt? (Fixed by increasing timeout, but Gemini API is currently reporting 429 Quota Exhausted).
AI should have same features as gemini CLI if it doesnt already. e.g. /dir add C:/MyDir     
DONE We currently have two clear buttons, one upper right and one in the bottom panel. only keep the bottom panel one.

## Web (new)
