# Tasks
When finishing a task make sure to prefix the line with "DONE" and also git commit.

## General

## For the hub

### Hub window


## in OmniSync.Android

### General
Different looking buttons, more sleep/modern would be nice

### Dashboard
Rename from "Dashboard" to "Dash" in the bottom navigation bar

### Remote Control Screen

When the android keyboard is not "up" then things look mostly fine, but once the keyboard comes up, there is a big black space between the keyboard and the button panel which is wasted space. I believe this is because the background of the button panel has a fixed height which include space for navigation bar. solution is probably to change the height of that background when and only when the keyboard is up.
Stream screen, replacing background of the trackpad leaving the trackpad functioning still, options to toggle monitor, pinch to zoom, (advanced feature, do last)       

### Files Screen
Refresh button
We have a bookmark button but nowhere to see or use the bookmarks. Make the bottom of the screen a super compact bookmark area
Downloading a video into app data and optionally password protecting it with encryption and password. Should be deletable
Video player pinch to zoom.
Android back button should prefer to go up in file system, only do default screen change if at file system root
The media player used already has next/previous buttons that work, disable the extra next/previous buttons added to the UI (we might want them back later). 
Support to open more video file types, .mpg .wmv .3gp (these currently crash the app after loading for a while) or at least dont crash.       

NOT-WORKING Swiping finger up and down on left side should change phone brightness and right side should change phone volume. Currently this is very hard to trigger, only when using multiple fingers and doing specific movements can i get it to activate
More Text editing fancy features, think like a lite code editor like notepad++ or VS code. be creative.
BUG When searching for a file and long tapping->open folder, it loads and times out. "Error loading directory, the source did mnot signal an event for 8 seconds".

### Browser control screen
NOT-WORKING Button to open a list of all tabs open in chrome. Closing a tab closes the current tab, not the one selected. The tab list should update after closing. The list is ugly and font a bit too small. 
NOT-WORKING Button to play/pause whatever media is currently playing (dunno how this could be done but give it a try)
The Clean tabs pattern window should show the default patterns as well but they should not be removable
Change the order of the clean tabs and tab list buttons and remove the text from Clean tabs (sweep icon is enough)
back button doesnt work (forward does). Error Uncaught (in promise) Error: Cannot find a next page in history.
spacebar button doesnt work, i can see hub log [12.57.09] Command Received: InputKeyPress but nothing happens (this used to work)

### Notification panel
NOT-WORKING. I think the app needs to request permissions for notifications or something. - In the android notification area there should be a panel with quick actions. Touching the notification outside the buttons should open the app.

### Settings screen (accessed by button on dashboard, not bottom panel)
Settings for what buttons should be in the notification quick actions panel, try to add as many possibilities here that you think could be done with a single button, especially from the Dashboard/Quick actions, remote control and browser control screens. also add option for custom buttons that will send a run/cmd command that will be executed on the pc.

### AI screen (new)
 ### AI screen (new)                                                                         │
│ DONE An AI screen that lets us talk to an LLM chatbot in a CLI running on the PC. Will work │
│ like gemini CLI but the interface is on the phone and the actions are on the PC. probably   │
│ involves making a custom version/branch/fork of gemini CLI (which is on github). I have a   │
│ fork checked out at D:\SSDProjects\Tools\gemini-cli but it needs an upstream remote and to  │
│ rebase on that remote, maybe diverge away from the one commit i put on top if conflicting   │
│ too much for now.   
  Progress Overview:
   1. Android UI: Created AiChatScreen with a modern chat interface, featuring message history,
      sender labels ("Me", "AI"), and auto-scrolling.
   2. Network Plumbing: Updated the Hub's RpcApiHub and the Android SignalRClient to facilitate
      bi-directional AI messaging.
   3. PC Listener: Developed OmniSync.Cli/ai_listener.py, which runs on your PC, listens for
      messages from your phone, and invokes your gemini-cli fork directly via Node.js.
   4. Verification: Validated the entire chain using TestScripts/test_ai_integration.py. The
      SignalR roundtrip is confirmed functional.

  Current Blocker:
  While the integration is working, the feature is currently non-responsive because your
  gemini-cli is reporting a Quota Exhaustion (429 RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED) from the Google API. The
  system is ready to go as soon as the API quota resets (estimated ~6 hours).   

## Web (new)
Integrate cortex scheduling into hub and show notifications on android phone when switching activity. Make this disableable in settings
Make a new page that is an exact copy of hub window
