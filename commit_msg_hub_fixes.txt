Fix Hub shutdown sound and Tray Icon exit issues

- Changed AudioService.PlaySound to use PlaySync to ensure sound finishes before disposal in background tasks.
- Fixed TrayIconManager.Dispose to use BeginInvoke for WPF shutdown and Application.Exit to cleanly terminate WinForms message loop.
- Updated TestScripts/test_hub_exit.py to wait longer for shutdown verification.
- Validated with TestScripts/test_shutdown_sound.py and test_hub_exit.py.
- Marked tasks as DONE in Tasks.txt.
