Fix Automatic Reconnect logic in SignalRClient

- Extracted connection success logic to onConnected().
- Ensured onConnected() is called both on initial connection completion and after a successful reconnection attempt in the loop.
- This fixes the issue where the app would stay in a disconnected state even after the Hub came back online.
- Marked 'Automatic reconnect' and 'Reconnect' as DONE in Tasks.txt.
