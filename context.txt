**Summary of Current State and Blockage**

The primary goal is to build the Android application located at `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android`. The build process is currently blocked by a persistent `java.nio.file.AccessDeniedException` during the `:app:mergeReleaseResources` task, specifically when trying to write to or delete files in `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android\app\build\intermediates\incremental\release\mergeReleaseResources\merged.dir\values`. This typically indicates a file locking issue on the user's system (e.g., by antivirus software or another process holding files open). User intervention is required to resolve this external issue.

**Identified Paths and Directories:**

*   **Project Root:** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni`
*   **Android Project Directory:** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android`
*   **Android Studio Installation:** `E:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio`
*   **Downloaded Gradle Distribution (extracted):** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\gradle-8.8\gradle-8.8`
*   **Gradle bin directory (from downloaded distribution):** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\gradle-8.8\gradle-8.8\bin`
*   **Java Runtime (JBR) directory (from Android Studio):** `E:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`
*   **Android SDK Path (provided by user):** `E:\SDKS\AndroidSDK`
*   **`local.properties` file:** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android\local.properties`
*   **`gradle.properties` file:** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android\gradle.properties`
*   **`accessibility_service_config.xml`:** `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android\app\src\main\res\xml\accessibility_service_config.xml`

**Key Modifications and Reasons:**

1.  **Generated Gradle Wrapper:** Since `gradlew` and `gradlew.bat` were missing, a Gradle 8.8 distribution was downloaded (`gradle-8.8-bin.zip`) and extracted. The `gradle.bat wrapper --gradle-version 8.8` command was then executed from the Android project directory to generate the necessary wrapper files.
2.  **Set `JAVA_HOME`:** Gradle builds failed because `JAVA_HOME` was not set. The Java Runtime bundled with Android Studio (`E:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr`) was located, and `JAVA_HOME` is explicitly set to this path for each Gradle command execution (e.g., `$env:JAVA_HOME="E:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr"; ...`).
3.  **Set `sdk.dir` in `local.properties`:** Initial build attempts failed with "SDK location not found." The `local.properties` file was created/modified in `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android` to include `sdk.dir=E:/SDKS/AndroidSDK` (using forward slashes) based on user-provided information.
4.  **Added `android.useAndroidX=true` to `gradle.properties`:** The build failed due to AndroidX dependencies without `android.useAndroidX=true` being set. A `gradle.properties` file was created in `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android` with this property.
5.  **Modified `accessibility_service_config.xml`:** An `Android resource linking failed` error occurred due to `typeAll` being incompatible with `accessibilityEventTypes`. This was changed to a list of common event types (`typeViewClicked|typeViewLongClicked|typeViewSelected|typeViewFocused|typeViewTextChanged|typeWindowContentChanged|typeWindowStateChanged`).
6.  **Cleaned and Forcefully Deleted Build Directory:** Repeated `AccessDeniedException` errors during `mergeReleaseResources` led to running `.\gradlew.bat clean` (which failed due to file locks) and then forcefully deleting `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android\app\build` using `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force`. However, the `AccessDeniedException` persists after this.

**Next Expected Action from User:**

The user needs to resolve the file locking issue on their system. They should ensure no applications are accessing files in `B:\GDrive\ProjectsG\Omni\OmniSync.Android\app\build` and potentially temporarily disable antivirus software before I can attempt the build again.

**Tools Used:**

*   `list_directory`
*   `run_shell_command` (including PowerShell commands like `Invoke-WebRequest`, `Expand-Archive`, `Get-ChildItem -Recurse`, and environment variable setting)
*   `write_file`
*   `replace`
*   `google_web_search`
*   `write_todos`

**To-Do List (Current):**

*   [completed] Download a Gradle distribution.
*   [completed] Locate a Java installation within Android Studio and use its java.exe to generate the Gradle wrapper.
*   [completed] Manually generate the Gradle wrapper files (`gradlew`, `gradlew.bat`, `gradle-wrapper.jar`) in the Android project.
*   [completed] Update sdk.dir in local.properties with the provided Android SDK path.
*   [completed] Add `android.useAndroidX=true` to `gradle.properties`.
*   [completed] Correct `accessibilityEventTypes` in `accessibility_service_config.xml` to use a list of common event types.
*   [in_progress] Resolve build errors
*   [pending] Build the Android application using the generated Gradle wrapper.
*   [pending] Verify the build output and locate the generated APK.
