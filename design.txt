# OmniSync: System Architecture Specification
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** December 8, 2025
**Status:** Approved for Implementation

## 1. Executive Summary
**OmniSync** is a local-first, high-privilege personal ecosystem designed to integrate a Windows PC, an Android Device, and a Web Browser. It functions as a private "nervous system" for the user's devices, enabling real-time automation, clipboard synchronization, file access, and remote input control.

Unlike commercial alternatives, OmniSync prioritizes **latency, privacy, and raw system access** over ease of mass distribution. It operates entirely over a private VPN mesh (Tailscale), requiring no public cloud servers. it is a custom system designed for a single users custom needs only, not broad user friendliness and must be highly extensible 

## 2. Design Principles
1.  **Local Authority:** The Windows PC is the "Source of Truth" and the central Hub. It does not rely on external cloud APIs for its core functionality.
2.  **High Privilege:** The system intentionally bypasses standard security sandboxes (using Accessibility Services on Android and User32.dll hooks on Windows) to enable "Power User" automation.
3.  **Modular Monolith:** The codebase will be structured as distinct services within a single executable/APK to allow for easy extensibility without the complexity of microservices.
4.  **Low Friction Deployment:** Build processes will be headless (CLI-based) to minimize manual configuration.

## 4. System Architecture Layers

### 4.1. The Windows Hub Architecture
The Windows application is the brain. It is structured into three vertical layers using Dependency Injection (DI).

**Layer 1: The Presentation (UI & Network)**
*   **`TrayIconManager`:** Manages the System Tray icon, Context Menu (Exit, Settings), and balloon notifications.
*   **`RpcApiHub`:** The endpoint for Clients. It exposes methods like `SendPayload()` and broadcasts events like `ClipboardUpdated`.

**Layer 2: The Logic (Services)**
*   **`CommandDispatcher`:** Receives generic commands (e.g., "CMD_PASTE", "CMD_OPEN_NOTE") and routes them to the correct service.
*   **`AuthService`:** Validates the GUID token from incoming connections.

**Layer 3: The Infrastructure (Hardware/OS Adapters)**
*   **`InputService`:** Wraps `user32.dll`. Handles `SendInput` (Keyboards/Mouse) to simulate physical hardware events.
*   **`ClipboardService`:** Wraps `Ole32.dll`. Monitors the system clipboard chain and handles read/write operations safely.
*   **`FileService`:** Provides safe I/O access to the specific Obsidian directory. Handles "Read" and "Append" logic.

### 4.2. The Android Client Architecture
The Android app is the primary sensor and remote control.

**Layer 1: The UI (View)**
*   **`DashboardScreen`:** Buttons for triggers (Macros, Wake-on-LAN replacement).
*   **`TrackpadScreen`:** Captures touch gestures and converts them to relative mouse coordinates.
*   **`NoteViewerScreen`:** Renders Markdown received from the Hub.

**Layer 2: The ViewModel (State)**
*   **`MainViewModel`:** Holds the state (Connected/Disconnected, Current Clipboard content).

**Layer 3: The Repository (Data/Network)**
*   **`SignalRClient`:** Singleton. Manages the WebSocket connection, auto-reconnect policy, and incoming message parsing.

**Layer 4: System Services**
*   **`OmniAccessibilityService`:** Listens for volume button presses (hardware macros) and injects text into other apps.
*   **`ClipboardWatcher`:** Uses system hooks (where allowed) or Accessibility node reading to detect copy events.

## 5. Data & Communication Protocol

### 5.1. The Payload Contract
To ensure extensibility, we will not create unique endpoints for every feature. We will use a **Command Pattern**.

All SignalR messages will follow this generic envelope:

```json
{
  "Target": "Windows",       // or "Android", "Firefox"
  "Command": "INPUT_KEYPRESS",
  "Payload": {               // Dynamic JSON object based on Command
    "Key": "MEDIA_NEXT_TRACK",
    "Modifier": "CTRL"
  },
  "Timestamp": 1700000000
}
```

### 5.2. Core Command Registry
The system will initially support these command sets:

| Domain | Command | Payload Example | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **System** | `PING` | `{}` | Bi-directional |
| **Input** | `MOUSE_MOVE` | `{ "x": 10, "y": -5 }` | Android -> Windows |
| **Input** | `KEY_PRESS` | `{ "keyCode": 65 }` | Android -> Windows |
| **Clipboard** | `UPDATE_CLIP` | `{ "text": "Hello World" }` | Bi-directional |
| **Files** | `GET_NOTE` | `{ "filename": "ToDo.md" }` | Android -> Windows |
| **Files** | `APPEND_NOTE`| `{ "filename": "Log.md", "content": "..." }` | Android -> Windows |

### 5.3. Conflict Resolution Strategy
*   **Clipboard:** Last Write Wins. If the PC and Phone copy text at the exact same second, the one that arrives at the Hub last overwrites the buffer.
*   **Files:**
    *   **Reading:** The PC reads the file from the disk *at the moment of request*.
    *   **Writing:** The Android app is restricted to **Append Only** or **Create New**. It cannot overwrite existing lines in Markdown files to prevent corrupting Obsidian's own sync process.

## 6. Implementation Guidelines (For AI)

### Phase 1: The Backbone
1.  Initialize the **.NET 9 Worker Service**. Implement the `RpcApiHub`.
2.  Initialize the **Android Project**. Add `Retrofit` and `SignalR-Client` dependencies.
3.  Establish the "Handshake": Android connects to Windows IP, sends Auth Token, Windows logs "Client Connected."

### Phase 2: Remote Control (Input)
1.  Implement `InputService.cs` in C# using `P/Invoke`. Create a safe wrapper for `SendInput`.
2.  Create the Android `Trackpad` UI. Send relative X/Y coordinates via SignalR.
3.  Tune latency: Ensure UDP-like performance over SignalR (use `FireAndForget` for mouse movement).

### Phase 3: Clipboard Sync
1.  Implement `ClipboardMonitor` in C#. Needs to be on a generic Thread with an ApartmentState of `STA` (Single Threaded Apartment) to access OLE Clipboard.
2.  Implement `ForegroundService` in Android.
3.  Wire up the events: PC Copy -> SignalR -> Android Paste.

### Phase 4: File Access
1.  Implement `FileService.cs` in C# with a hardcoded `RootPath` (e.g., User's Documents/Obsidian).
2.  Add logic to sanitize file paths (prevent ".." directory traversal attacks).
3.  Build the Android "Note List" UI that queries the server.

## 7. Security & Deployment

### Security
*   **User Priority:** Security measures should never introduce friction or inconvenience for the user. Ease of use and seamless operation take precedence over stringent security protocols.
*   **Transport:** Traffic is encrypted by the Tailscale tunnel (WireGuard).
*   **Application:** A `secrets.json` file on the PC will hold a generated API Key.
*   **Android:** The API Key must be entered once in the App Settings.

### Deployment Workflow
*   **Windows:**
    *   Run `dotnet publish -c Release`.
    *   Output: `OmniSync.exe`.
    *   Action: User places it in `shell:startup` for auto-boot.
*   **Android:**
    *   Run `.\deploy.bat` (Encapsulates `gradlew installDebug`).
    *   Action: Pushes APK via USB and launches it.

## 8. Future Extensibility
*   **Firefox:** The browser extension will act as just another "Client" connecting to the same RPC API Hub.
*   **UI Separation:** The C# "Server" logic is decoupled from the UI. In the future, we can move the UI to a separate WPF app that communicates with the Service via Named Pipes, leaving the Service headless.
