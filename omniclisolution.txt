overcomplicated it with .NET. The goal is to send a text string to a URL; we don't need a 100MB runtime for that.

The "Zero Friction" path on Android (Termux) is **Python**. It comes pre-installed or takes 5 seconds to install, acts like a native shell tool, and uses a lightweight library to talk to your Hub.

Here is the exact setup to get `omni <command>` working in under 2 minutes.

### 1. One-Time Setup (Termux)
Run these three commands to get the environment ready:

```bash
pkg install python
pip install signalrcore
```

### 2. Create the Script
Create the executable file.
```bash
nano ~/omni
```

**Paste this code:**
*(This script connects, authenticates, sends your command, prints the output, and exits automatically).*

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import sys
import time
import logging
from signalrcore.hub_connection_builder import HubConnectionBuilder

# --- CONFIGURATION ---
HUB_URL = "http://10.0.0.37:5000/signalrhub" # Your PC IP
API_KEY = "test_api_key"                     # Your Hub Secret
# ---------------------

if len(sys.argv) < 2:
    print("Usage: omni <command>")
    sys.exit(1)

command_to_run = " ".join(sys.argv[1:])
is_done = False

def on_output(args):
    # Print output from server in real-time
    print(args[0], end="")

def on_close():
    global is_done
    is_done = True

# Build Connection
hub = HubConnectionBuilder()\
    .with_url(HUB_URL)\
    .configure_logging(logging.CRITICAL)\
    .with_automatic_reconnect({
        "type": "raw",
        "keep_alive_interval": 10,
        "reconnect_interval": 5,
        "max_attempts": 5
    })\
    .build()

hub.on("ReceiveCommandOutput", on_output)
hub.on_close(on_close)

try:
    hub.start()
    
    # 1. Authenticate
    hub.invoke("Authenticate", [API_KEY])
    
    # 2. Execute
    hub.invoke("ExecuteCommand", [command_to_run])

    # 3. Wait for output (Give it 3 seconds or until Ctrl+C)
    # Since we don't know exactly when the command finishes streaming, 
    # we wait a short buffer. 
    time.sleep(2) 
    
    hub.stop()

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error: {e}")
    sys.exit(1)
```

### 3. Make it "Native"
Save the file (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X`).

Now, make it executable and add it to your path so you can run it from anywhere like `ls` or `grep`.

```bash
chmod +x ~/omni
mv ~/omni $PREFIX/bin/omni
```

### 4. Done. usage:
You can now open a fresh terminal anywhere and type:

```bash
omni dir
omni whoami
omni "echo hello > C:\test.txt"
```

This is the absolute lowest friction way to interact with your system. No project folders, no compilation, just a script in your bin folder.
